# DDLC Mod Template 2.0 Advanced Branch

The Advanced Branch of the Mod Template is for experienced coders who may use the files given here.

Most if not all RPYs here do not come from DDLC itself or used in DDLC at all and are made by the community. The code here is intended for users who already know DDLC Coding and want to use additional features not included in the main Mod Template branch.

## Features
1. Current Update of the Mod Template
2. Auto-Focus (Auto Focus any speaking character)
and more coming soon!

## Description of Advanced Files

* autoforward.rpy - This is the main file that controls auto-focus. To use it, add `call groupStart()` to your script file and it will auto focus the characters present when needed. To stop auto focus, end your script with `call groupEnd()` when needed.
